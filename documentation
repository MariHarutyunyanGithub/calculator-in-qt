 * When percent button is pressed, the value of the label expression is calculated,
   the result is divided by 100 and written to label.

 * The dot button is used to write fractional numbers.

 * When the equation button is clicked, the value of the label expression is calculated and written to label.

 * For each of the mathematical operations and number buttons, the appropriate symbol is written in the label.

 * Moreover, all possible logical and illogical cases are considered for each button․
